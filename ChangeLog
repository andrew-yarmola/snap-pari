2009-12-03  Matthias Goerner <matthias@math.berkeley.edu>
	* fixed bug in make_inlines, added pari_oldnames.hh and modified
	  configure.ac so that snap can be compiled with pari < 2.2 and >=
	  2.2
	* fixed various little issues when compiling with newer versions
	  of g++

2004-02-03  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Merged tube_help into snap_help, merged all tube functionality
	  into snap, rationalized away it_with_tube and it_with_dd_tiling.

2003-07-15  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

	* Added "show help" command. 

	* Finished converting to use GNU autoconf/automake. To be released
          as version 1.10.2.

2003-05-27  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed get_transform which gave incorrect result for orientation
          reversing transformations.  Added code to keep track of vertex
          positions through the canonical_retriangulation code of
          canonize_part_2.c. Now "print hidden symmetries" works even when
          the canonical cell decomposition is not a triangulation. Added
          "print -h symmetry action" to show the action of the hidden
          symmetries on the current list of geodesics.

2003-05-22  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Updated and reorganized snap_help. Fixed a number of small
          inconsistencies in the program while I was at it. Tidied up the
          output of the various gluing equation printing programs.

2003-04-17  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed some major problems with eta invariant code caused by
          careless changes made when adding (limited) support for cone
          manifolds.

2002-11-27  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bug in fixed_points function which was giving wrong number
          of fixed points and messing up the evaluate function.

2002-11-26  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added code to verify the core tube radius by computing a core
          tube to the peripheral_curve function.

2002-11-25  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bug in fwprint which occasionally caused 10. to be printed
          using one character more than specified. Fixed some problems
          with division by zero in snap when degenerate structures arise.

2002-11-14  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Sorted out some precision issues with snap. The number prec has
          to be the number of longwords of precision required PLUS TWO!

2002-07-20  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Did a complete redesign of pariwrap. "pari" objects now have a
          choice whether to live on the stack or in free store as
          clones. The idea of this is to enable us eventually to modify
          the GP calculator so that snap data structures can coexist with
          the types that GP already understands.

2002-07-10  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added function "peripheral_curve" to print out how volume, core
          geodesic length, and tube radius depend on surgery.

2002-06-15  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added function to test if a manifold is a two-bridge knot
          complement.

2002-06-14  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added Makefile entries to pick up the various slight
          discrepancies arising from my less than ideal way of handling
          nonorientable manifolds above.

2002-06-13  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Completed run of census data. Did lots of work on Makefile to
          produce files presenting the resulting data in various useful
          ways.

2002-06-11  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Wrote update_comm_data to merge output of link_comm with
          comm_data file (rather than having link_comm have to
          inefficiently rewrite the whole comm_data file every time it
          runs).

2002-06-06  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Modified link_comm to handle nonorientable manifolds (albeit not
          in the nicest possible way, it just takes double covers;
          actually at wrong point in code allowing for discrepancy between
          number of cusps in manifold_spec and rest of resulting record).
          Wrote code sorted_file.cc/hh so that when I re-run link_comm
          with special parameters for difficult cases it won't mess up the
          output file by creating duplicates.

2002-06-05  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Modified link_comm to work for census manifolds as well.

2002-05-30  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added readline to menu.cc.

2002-05-29  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Snap and tube now share common code in basic_state.cc.

2002-05-27  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Started converting tube_main.cc into basic_state.cc and
          tube_prog.cc so that snap and tube can share all common
          functions as common code.

2002-05-21  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Did lots of work with link_comm and find_classes to create
          link_data and grouped_link_data in snap/Links directory. Also
          wrote a Makefile and some perl scripts (mainly in ~/bin) to
          maintain these files and extract some statistics on them.

        * Wrote function to compute cusp covering degrees: removes the
          need for all tricky numerics involving cusp sizes.

2002-05-15  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bug in hilbert symbol code in algebraic.cc caused by using
          the unsafe function exact_value(), and corresponding bug in
          link_comm.  Modified README, pariclass.hh and O31_GEN.c to work
          with pari-2.0.10.beta rather than with later versions of pari
          (since later versions have a bug in polredabs). This change will
          be reflected in the next distribution of snap unless the pari
          people fix it first.  Fixed field_db code which was getting
          confused if the maximum index for a given degree wasn't one less
          than the number of fields of that degree.

2002-05-14  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Tidied up format of link_data file. Moved information about
          field finding failures to separate file, fields_unknown.
          Implemented better arithmeticity test using invariant trace
          field generators as per Craig's suggestion (also in snap as
          "test traces").

2002-05-13  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added flag to allow Dirichlet domains with fixed basepoint.
          Modified link_comm to save more information from the numerical
          arithmeticity test.  Fixed bug which was causing bigons to
          appear in polytope computation.  Fixed small problem which was
          slowing Damian's code down hugely.  Modified polytope code to do
          a 3-way equal/unknown/unequal test: a warning is printed if the
          result is unknown (assumed unequal).

2002-05-10  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Worked on doing some of the 11-crossing cases by hand.

2002-05-09  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed problem with (tied) tilt_polytope calculation.
          Recalculated the affected commensurators by hand.

2002-05-08  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Completed first version of link_commensurator.cc and started it
          on a major run.  Found problem with verify() function: some
          inaccuracy in verifying the numerical logarithmic gluing
          equations.  Found problem in tilt_polytope computation.  Found
          that this function is occasionally called with cusp_size outside
          the face defined by the tilts somehow.

2002-05-06  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Wrote code for maintaining a database of fields.

2002-05-03  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Modified precision in "snap" to be in terms of 32-bit words.

2002-05-02  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bug in exact cusp commensurability testing (matrix had one
          too few columns!)  Added cusp ties to tilt polytope computation.

2002-05-01  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bugs in eta invariant code caused by changes to the
          surgery coefficient vector (length now 3*n_cusps since rational
          coefficients were permitted).  Added printout of cusp action to
          "isometry" function in "snap".  Added cusp size/area printout to
          "print hidden_symmetries" and "print commensurator" functions.
          Added numeric non-arithmeticity test to "snap".

2002-04-30  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Removed it_with_isometries code.  Added triangulation_changing()
          function to keep things up to date when the triangulation
          changes but the manifold stays the same.  Added numeric cusp
          commensurability test to snap.

2002-04-24  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Modified "print commensurator" to use tilt polytope for multi
          cusped manifolds. Original function renamed to "print
          hidden_symmetries".  Added "commensurability" function to check
          if two manifolds are commensurable.

2002-04-22  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added computation of tilt polytope to tube.

        * Modified proto_canonize to accept size rather than area
          multipliers in preparation for tilt polytope computation and use
          displacement_exp (cusp cross section size) in computation.

2002-04-19  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Wrote polytope.cc/hh, n_vector.cc/hh and started
          tilt_polytope.cc/hh for computing the tilt polytope of a cusped
          manifold.

2002-04-15  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added code to compute a tilt matrix which determines the set of
          cusp heights for which a triangulation is dual to the Ford
          spine.

2002-04-12  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added computation of equivalence classes of cusp under hidden
          symmetries found by Damian's commens code, now printed out by
          the "print commensurator" function.

        * Simplified cusp commensurability test: test can be done in shape
          field, don't need to find all the cusp fields.

2002-04-11  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Fixed bug in "ident" function which was giving a fatal error.

        * Added "print cusp commensurability" to "snap". Does exact
          commensurability test on cusp shapes; requires shape field.

        * Added read link function to "tube". 

        * Made new file helpers.cc/hh shared between snap and tube for
          interactive functions which will be shared by snap_main and
          tube_main but do not belong in it_with_dd_tiling.

        * Adapted and compiled Morwen Thistlethwaite's dt2snap code for
          reading Dowker-Thistlethwaite codes for links.

2002-04-05  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added extra argument to "canonize" such that a ratio of cusp
          neighborhood areas can be specified for any manifold having 2 or
          more cusps.

2002-04-01  Oliver Goodman  <oag@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

        * Added code to allow snap to compute exact shapes when surgery
          results in a cone manifold structure with cone angles a rational
          multiple of pi. Added "cone_surgery" function to support entry
          of such surgery coefficients.

        * Compiled Damian's commens.cc in tube dir. Added a "print
          commensurator" function to print the commensurator of any
          non-arithmetic 1-cusped manifold.

	* Added an option to normalize shapes in printout of low
	  precision shape parameters in snap.
