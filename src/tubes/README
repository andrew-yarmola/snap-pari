number_ccbig

Reads ~/snap/snap_data/closed_census.big-jw and ClosedManifolds (in same dir) 
and writes on standard output a numbered version of closed_census.big
(saved as closed_census.big-num in snap_data).

components < complements

Reads from standard input, lines in the format of "complements" and tells us 
how many connected components the graph of surgery relations has. 

fix_drillings

Updates "complements" file from the contents of "drilling_data". Takes no
arguments or input other than these files. Renames old versions to "*~". 

big_inj

Reads lines on standard input in "complements" format and prints out those
whose injectivity radius exceeds 0.01. 

long_geod

Reads lines on standard input in "complements" format and prints out those
whose length exceeds 2.5.

find_volrpt 

Reads lines on standard input in "complements" format and prints out the
closed manifold numbers and complement volumes of any closed manifolds
which have repeated volumes among their drillings. 

find_comprpt < complements

Look for instances of two different geodesics being drilled from a manifold
giving the same complements. 

../tubal <index> <surgery-description>

Tries to compute a local core tube for the given surgery description. 
Writes a line in complements format if everything works out (i.e. the 
tube domain for this filling is combinatorially equivalent to the Ford
domain of the cusped manifold). Otherwise it writes out everything
it could determine followed by a keyword saying what the failure was. 
Output from this program, applied to every manifold from closed_census.big
which was not found in "complements" is in the file tubality. 

test_tube

Reads a file containing lines of the form "<index> <surgery-description>"
and writes the result of ../tubal on each line to the file "tubality". 
Input should come from ccbig_diffs. 

ccbig_diffs

Prints all surgery descriptions in closed_census.big-num which were not
found in "complements". 

stats < complements

Prints out how many manifolds of each number of tetrahedra are given
as complements and the grand total. 

find_missing < complements

Prints out any closed manifold numbers not found in the complements file. 
(Should be none.)
