All types which support < should provide >, <= and >=. 

Implement Chern-Simons for manifolds having an acyclic 
edge orientation. 

 - Modify the reorient_tetrahedron function in orient.cc
   so that it can apply an arbitrary permutation to the 
   vertices of a tetrahedron. 

Implement Chern-Simons in general by using one-finite-
-vertex retriangulation. 

Write tube code to fix up non-tubal triangulations. 

 - Split function still seems to get the wrong 
   faces most of the time. Look into this. 

 - Then get the tubality test working when there 
   are repeated edges at least.

Write read/write functions for tube domains: basically
this means the ortholength invariant and the combinatorial
triangulation. 

OR make the core tube triangulation properly local. 

 - It can use words (and a representation of the group)
   to get the elements for a face and its boundary curves. 

 - When a change of combinatorics is indicated it can 
   use the existing words to work out some new ones. 

Code to compute the holonomy of a closed geodesic:

 - A geodesic (given in the universal cover) should be
   able to be diced into intervals in the Dirichlet domain
   and face pairing transformations composed to find a
   matrix and a word for the group element.
