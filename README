ABOUT SNAP
----------
Snap is a program derived from Jeff Weeks' program SnapPea. Its main
function is to compute arithmetic invariants of hyperbolic
3-manifolds. See the paper "Computing arithmetic invariants of
3-manifolds," by Coulson, Goodman, Hodgson and Neumann, in
Experimental Mathematics, Vol.9 (2000) Issue 1, available
electronically from the publisher at http://www.expmath.org, and also
included with the distribution in preprint form. See also articles by
Neumann, Reid et.al. in Topology '90, Proceedings of the Research
Semester in Low Dimensional Topology at Ohio State University. Berlin
New York: de Gruyter 1992, for information about invariant trace
fields and arithmetic invariants of 3-manifolds in general.

Snap runs as a standalone Unix program. It presents the user with a
command line interface which can be used to load and save
SnapPea manifold files and compute arithmetic invariants and other
information about them. It uses the number theory package Pari to
do high precision arithmetic and number theoretic computations.

SYSTEM/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------
Snap 1.11 has been tested with Pari version 2.1.4 to 2.1.7
and less thoroughly with versions up to 2.3.4. 

It has been developed under various operating systems with gcc
versions through gcc 4.4.1

AVAILABILITY
------------

Snap is hosted on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/snap-pari/

Pari is available via http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/

COMPILING AND INSTALLING
------------------------
Snap requires Pari and GNU Readline to be installed. If you wish to
install in the default location, /usr/local, simply type 

  ./configure

followed by 

  make install

(or perhaps, "sudo make install"). This will install "snap" and
"tube" in "/usr/local/bin" and the help text and various data files 
in "/usr/local/share/snap_data".

NOTES FOR USERS OF OLDER VERSIONS OF SNAP
-----------------------------------------

1. There was a problem with some of the precomputed tables of
arithmetic invariants supplied prior to version 1.8.1: a coding error
in the program used to compute these invariants led to some manifolds
being incorrectly reported as having integer traces when this was not
in fact the case. This error was not present in any 1.7* version of
the program Snap itself, only the tables supplied with it.

2. Versions of Snap prior to 1.8.0 made the mistaken assumption that
all versions of Pari would compute the kernel of an integer linear
transformation in the same way. This unfortunate assumption has led to
some users of Snap (PC/DOS users only as far as I know) obtaining
incorrect values from the eta invariant function, presumably after the
Pari people changed something. This bug has been fixed in the current
version of Snap.

PARI polredabs() BUG
--------------------

Certain versions of Pari (from some time between 2.0.10 and 2.0.20 to
some time before 2.1.4) contain a bug in the polredabs() function
which prevents snap from correctly finding canonical polynomials. You
can compile snap with these versions of Pari if you are not concerned
with seeing canonical field representations.  (To check for this bug,
run gp and do polredabs(x^2 - 2*x + 10). If it is fixed the answer
should be x^2 + 1.)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

You can read the files data/snap_help and data/sample_session. The
file snap_help is the file which is read by snap's online help
function. See also the paper "Computing arithmetic invariants of
3-manifolds" by Coulson, Goodman, Hodgson and Neumann: this is
included as paper/snap.tex (and also paper/snap.ps).
